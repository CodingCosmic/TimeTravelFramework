## Description
This project provides an interactive web application to visualize and experiment with the effects of distorting time and other aspects described in our integrative framework for theoretical time travel.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CodingCosmic/TimeTravelFramework.git
    cd TimeTravelFramework
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Conceptual Formula
\[ C = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \left[ \Psi(T) \cdot \left( E + S(f, A) + \Phi \right) \cdot (L - D) \cdot (M \cdot \bar{M}) \right] dt + I \]
